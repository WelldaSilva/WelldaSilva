<h1>Hi! I'm Wellington da Silva!</h1>
<p>I'm a linguist (with a PhD from the University of Campinas - UNICAMP, 2019) and a Data Science enthusiast and learner.</p>
<p>As a linguist, I have 9+ years of experience designing and carrying out experiments to gather
speech samples and perceptual data, performing acoustic analysis of speech (transcribing,
segmenting and analyzing prosodic and acoustic parameters), and performing statistical
analysis (descriptive and inferential).</p>

<p>Below you find some personal projects I've worked on to practice my Data Science skills.</p>
