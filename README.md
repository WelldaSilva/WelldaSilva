<h1>Hi! I'm Wellington da Silva!</h1>
<p>I'm a linguist (with a PhD from the University of Campinas - UNICAMP, 2019) and a Data Science Specialist (USP, 2023).</p>
<p>As a linguist, I have 9+ years of experience designing and carrying out experiments to gather
speech samples and perceptual data, performing acoustic analysis of speech (transcribing,
segmenting and analyzing prosodic and acoustic parameters), and performing statistical
analysis (descriptive and inferential).</p>

<p>Below you find some personal projects I've worked on to practice my Data Science skills.</p>

### Topic Modeling

![NLP](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NLP-brightgreen) [![R](https://img.shields.io/badge/R-276DC3?logo=r&logoColor=white)](https://www.r-project.org/) ![Topic-Modeling](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Topic%20Modeling-8A2BE2) ![web-scraping](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Web%20Scraping-lightgrey)

This is an end-to-end Natural Language Processing project in which I collect consumers complaints from the Web and perform Topic Modeling on them. The project is presented here in two parts:

### [Web scraping with RSelenium, Rvest, and SQL](https://welldasilva.github.io/mba-usp-project/web_scraping_in_r/)

<p>Here I leverage some <strong>R</strong> packages, such as <strong>RSelenium</strong> and <strong>Rvest</strong>, to scrape consumers complaints from the Web and store them in an <strong>SQLite</strong> database.</p>

### [Topic modeling in e-commerce consumer complaints](https://welldasilva.github.io/mba-usp-project/topic-modeling/)

<p>In this project I use <strong>R</strong> to apply a popular <strong>topic modeling technique</strong>, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), to analyze e-commerce consumer complaints.</p>

### [DVD Rental Store Database Analysis](https://welldasilva.github.io/dvd-rental-store-database-analysis/)

![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-%2300f.svg?style=flat&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)

<p>In this project I leverage <strong>SQL</strong> with <strong>MySQL</strong> to perform an exploratory data analysis on a DVD rental store database.</p>

### [News Article Summarizer](https://welldasilva.github.io/news-article-summarizer/)

[![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-%233776AB?logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://www.python.org/) ![web-scraping](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Web%20Scraping-lightgrey) ![NLP](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NLP-brightgreen)

<p>In this project, I perform <strong>web scraping</strong> to get some news articles in Portuguese and apply <strong>Natural Language Processing</strong> techniques (e.g. tokenization, stopwords and special characters removal, stemming, and term frequency count) to build a rule-based summarizer in <strong>Python</strong> code.</p>
